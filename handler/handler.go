package handler

// This file is intentionally left blank as a placeholder for future handler implementations.
// Individual handler functions are defined in their respective files within the same package.
// For example, createUser.go, updateUser.go, deleteUser.go, and showUser.go each contain
// specific handler functions related to user operations.
